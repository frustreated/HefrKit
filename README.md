# HefrKit
Capcom exploit with reflective driver loader all packaged into one deliverable executable

This is another exploit example for capcom.sys. The code packages the capcom.sys and a driver to deliver into a user executable, HefrSploit.exe. HefrSploit, will write capcom.sys to disk, exploit it and load the packaged driver.

To use it is recommended to use the provided solution. Add your driver code and you're good to go.

Might in future make the loader a little more advanced by not using resource files and eliminating strings.

Build tested on Visual Studio 2017 with SDK 10.0.10586.0.
Tested on Windows 10 RS3
